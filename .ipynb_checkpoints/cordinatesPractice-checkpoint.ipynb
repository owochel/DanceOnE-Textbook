The coordinates are represented as **x** and **y** in danceOn. **x** represents where the object is on the horizontal axis, and **y** represents where the object is on the vertical axis. At the origin, being the **upper left** of the window, both the coordinate x and coordinate y are 0. At the **lower right** of the window, x is width-1, and y is height-1."
