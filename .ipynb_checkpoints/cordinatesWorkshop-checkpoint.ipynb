    "In danceON, all shapes drawn to the screen have a position that is specified as a coordinate. All coordinates are measured as the distance from the origin in units of pixels. The coordinates are represented as **x** and **y** in danceON. **x** represents where the object is on the horizontal axis, and **y** represents where the object is on the vertical axis. At the origin, being the **upper left** of the window, both the coordinate x and coordinate y are 0. At the **lower right** of the window, x is width, and y is height.\n"
