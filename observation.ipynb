The ball and the figure is slightly in front of the umbrella, and they seem to be on a beach based on the texture of the contact surface. The sea level is in the far background and runs through the image slightly below the horizontal centre line. More to the background, there are a few pieces of cloud in the sky. Everything is grayscaled other than the umbrella, the ball, and the circular shape covering the person's face. The umberlla is solid light orange and has multiple shaded ciruclar dots as its pattern. The ball is solid green and simplified. It doesn't look like a photographed ball but more like the geometric circular shape. The circular shape covering the person's face is blue and resambles the ball in its simplifed texture and geometric shape. The person has shoulder-length curled black hair and is wearing a patterend swimsuit. Standing on the ball with their right foot, the person's left foot  knees are slightly bent. The person has their hand swinging outwards and wide open. -->"
