    "text": "In danceOn, all shapes drawn to the screen have a position that is specified as a coordinate. All coordinates are measured as the distance from the origin in units of pixels. The coordinates are represented as x and y in danceOn. x represents where the object is on the horizontal axis, and y represents where the object is on the vertical axis. At the origin, being the upper left of the window, both the coordinate x and coordinate y are 0. At the lower right of the window, x is width, and y is height.\nAs a result, the coordinates system in dance on could be understand as Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A coordinates system map that shows 4 different points for (red, top left) {x: 0, y:0}, (purple, bottom left) {x: 0, y:height}, (orange, top right) {x: width, y: 0}, (pink, buttom right){x: width, y: height}\n\n\nThis x and y expression are universal in the languages for danceOn. It is common to find x and y used to express things related to the coordinates systems.\nWhen you see x and y at the begining of a line where they appears by themselves such as “x:” or “y:”, it means you are defining the location of the object you are currently programming.\nHowever, the x and y are also used to express some pre-defined location variables for poses. For instance, you may see the name for poses are called something like “pose.nose.x” or “pose.leftWrist.y”. When the x and y appears as a suffix after body parts names, they are used to express the specific numbers of coordinates of the body parts at different times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy would you also use x and y for “pose.nose.x” and “pose.leftWrist.y” instead of numbers?\n\nObserver the location of the poses keypoints (nose,leftWrist, leftEye, etc) on your danceOn canvas, you may easily find out that the locations of the key points changes throughout the progression of your videos/webcame recordings. Becasue we are dealing with numbers that are constantly changing when refering to coordinates of the pose keypoints, it is easier to represent the location with variables(names for changing numbers).\nHaving x and y as the names indicates that they are in the same coordinates system with your object – “x:” or “y:”."
